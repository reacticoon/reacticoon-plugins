# Have i been pwned

This plugin provides containers to interact with the [have i been pwned api](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

> The API allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched 
> via a RESTful service. 

We use [hibp library](https://github.com/wKovacs64/hibp) under the hood.
